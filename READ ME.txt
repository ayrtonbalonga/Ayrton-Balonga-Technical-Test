Hi 

if you want to run the API in the folder named "AllNodeApp" via Visual Studio code run the code "node Server,js"


now i have tried the display the full path where the API is running then i baven't been able to display the data 
coming from the API to display on the Angular, i can retrieve the data but i stuck

if you want to run the Angular App run this command "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json"
